Smart AI News Radio

This project is a fully automated, cloud-based news radio system that summarizes content from your favorite news sources (RSS) using Amazon Bedrock (AI) and delivers it in a professional radio host voice using Amazon Polly (Neural Engine). 🚀

Key Features

AI-Powered Summarization:
Raw news articles are transformed into fluent, concise bulletins using Claude 3 (Haiku).

Neural Text-to-Speech:
News is narrated in a natural, clear, human-like voice using Polly’s most advanced Neural Engine technology.

Fully Automated Architecture:
The entire infrastructure is managed with Terraform (Infrastructure as Code).

CI/CD Pipeline:
With GitHub Actions and Docker integration, the application is automatically deployed on AWS whenever the code is updated.

Edge Delivery:
Content is delivered worldwide with low latency via the CloudFront CDN.


🏗️ Architecture

The application is built entirely on serverless and managed services:

News Fetching:
A Python-based worker scans RSS feeds.

Control Mechanism:
DynamoDB ensures previously processed news items are skipped (cost and performance optimization).

AI Processing:
Amazon Bedrock summarizes raw text in a radio host tone.

Text-to-Speech:
Amazon Polly converts the summarized text into high-quality MP3 audio files.

Storage & Delivery:
Audio files and news lists are stored in S3 and served via CloudFront.

Orchestration:
The entire workflow runs periodically on AWS ECS (Fargate).

📦 Setup & Deployment
1. Initialize Infrastructure
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply

2. Application Deployment

The project is integrated with GitHub Actions. Every push to the main branch builds a new Docker image and updates the task running on AWS ECS.

📅 Future Plans (Roadmap)

 Categorization of multiple RSS sources

 An admin panel allowing users to add their own RSS links

Note:
This project is an engineering effort that brings together modern cloud technologies and generative artificial intelligence.
